The examples in here are meant to be used as test cases only. You should not depend on any of the data in here to be accurate or up to date, or even real.

Most of the examples come from a copy of the SOTA Summits List dated 2020-02-23. I don't see any licensing information or copyright information on the SOTA data website, but given that the database is freely downloadable from the internet, I'm going to assume that I can use portions of it in tests and examples under fair use.
